# Setifier Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my creative portfolio, a game-like experience to showcase my projects.

## Overview

This is a vanilla JavaScript project that uses Three.js for the 3D planet selection screen and custom CSS for the UI. The portfolio is designed to be an interactive and engaging way to explore my work in web development, design, and art.

## Features

-   **3D Universe Selection:** A Three.js-powered main screen where each planet represents a different skill universe.
-   **Dynamic Content Loading:** Project data is loaded from JSON files, making it easy to update and manage.
-   **Custom Procedural Textures:** Planet textures are generated procedurally using the HTML5 Canvas API.
-   **Interactive UI:** The interface is built with custom CSS and JavaScript to create a game-like feel.
